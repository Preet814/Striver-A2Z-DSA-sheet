You are given an array arr of positive integers. Your task is to find all the leaders in the array. An element is considered a leader if it is greater than or equal to all elements to its right. The rightmost element is always a leader.

Examples:
Input: arr = [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2]
Output: [17, 5, 2]
Explanation: Note that there is nothing greater on the right side of 17, 5 and, 2.


class Solution {
    // Function to find the leaders in the array.
  public:
    vector<int> leaders(vector<int>& arr) {
        vector<int> ans;
        int n=arr.size();
        stack<int> st;
        st.push(arr[n-1]);
        for(int i=n-2;i>=0;i--){
            if(arr[i]>=st.top()){
                st.push(arr[i]);
            }
        }
        while(!st.empty()){
            ans.push_back(st.top());
            st.pop();
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
