Given a sorted array arr[] (with unique elements) and an integer k, find the index (0-based) of the largest element in arr[] that is less than or equal to k. This element is called the "floor" of k. If such an element does not exist, return -1.

Examples

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], k = 0
Output: -1
Explanation: No element less than 0 is found. So output is -1.



class Solution {
  public:

    int findFloor(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        int n=arr.size();
        int s=0,e=n-1;
        int ans=-1;
        while(s<=e){
            int mid=s+(e-s)/2;
            if(arr[mid]<=k){
                s=mid+1;
                ans=mid;
            }
            else{
                e=mid-1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
